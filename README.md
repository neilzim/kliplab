A toolkit for post-processing coronagraph images, developed in the context of laboratory experiments and demonstrations of technologies to image exoplanets with future space observatories.

Core functions:

* Reference differential imaging subtraction using Karhounen-Loeve Image Projection (KLIP) algorithm.

* Contrast floor measurement, taking into account spatially varying, off-axis coronagraph throughput, and oversubtraction.
